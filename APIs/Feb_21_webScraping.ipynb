    "There are several methods used for web scraping, depending on the type of data being extracted and the structure\n",
    "     of the website being scraped. Here are some of the most common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parsing HTML: This method involves parsing the HTML code of a website to extract specific data using regular \n",
    "     expressions or other parsing techniques. It is one of the simplest methods, but it can be limited by changes \n",
    "     to the website's HTML structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Web Scraping Libraries: Developers often use web scraping libraries like Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, or Puppeteer, \n",
    "     which provide pre-built functions and methods for accessing and scraping data from websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. APIs: Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access data in \n",
    "     a structured format. APIs can be used to extract data in real-time, and they often provide more reliable and \n",
    "     up-to-date data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Headless Browsers: This method involves using headless browsers like PhantomJS or Selenium to automate web \n",
    "     browsing and extract data from dynamic websites that require user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Machine Learning: Some web scraping tasks can be automated using machine learning algorithms that can \n",
    "     identify patterns and extract data automatically. This method requires significant data preparation and \n",
    "     training, but it can be more powerful and flexible than other methods."

    "     requests and pandas, to handle HTTP requests and manage scraped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Open source and community-driven: Beautiful Soup is an open-source library, meaning that it is freely \n",
