    "There are two main types of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics is concerned with summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. It involves calculating measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, and range to describe the distribution of the data.\n",
    "Example: Suppose you want to describe the salaries of employees in a company. Descriptive statistics can be used to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the salaries to understand the central tendency and variability of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics is concerned with making inferences or generalizations about a population based on a sample of data. It involves testing hypotheses, estimating parameters, and making predictions using statistical models.\n",
    "Example: Suppose you want to know if the average height of male students in a college is significantly different from the national average height. Inferential statistics can be used to test a hypothesis by collecting a random sample of male students, calculating the sample mean and standard deviation, and conducting a hypothesis test to determine if the difference between the sample mean and national mean is statistically significant."
