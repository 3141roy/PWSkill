    "Ways in which Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature randomness: At each node of each decision tree, Random Forest Regressor randomly selects a subset of features to use for splitting the data. This means that each tree in the forest is trained on a different subset of features, which helps to reduce the correlation between the trees and improve the generalization performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bagging: Random Forest Regressor uses bagging, which involves training each decision tree on a bootstrap sample of the data. This means that each tree in the forest is trained on a different subset of the data, which helps to reduce the variance of the model and improve the stability of the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ensemble averaging: Random Forest Regressor combines the predictions of multiple decision trees by averaging their outputs. This means that the final prediction is a combination of the predictions of multiple trees, which helps to reduce the impact of outliers and noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Pruning: Random Forest Regressor uses pruning to prevent overfitting by stopping the growth of the decision trees when they become too complex. This means that the trees in the forest are not allowed to become too deep or too complex, which helps to prevent them from memorizing the training data and overfitting."

    "\n",
    "4. min_samples_split: This is the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node of each decision tree. Setting this hyperparameter can help to prevent overfitting by requiring a minimum amount of data for each split.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. min_samples_leaf: This is the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node of each decision tree. Setting this hyperparameter can help to prevent overfitting by requiring a minimum number of samples at each leaf.\n",

    "6. bootstrap: This is a Boolean hyperparameter that determines whether to use bagging or not. If set to True, each decision tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data.\n",

However, for small datasets or datasets with simple relationships, Decision Tree Regressor may perform better than Random Forest Regressor."
