    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a computer system. It provides a way to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two main types of databases. The main differences between these two types are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data structure: SQL databases use a structured format, with tables that have fixed schemas, while NoSQL databases can be structured or unstructured and do not use tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, which means they can easily accommodate growing amounts of data across multiple servers. SQL databases, on the other hand, are designed to scale vertically, which means they require more powerful hardware to handle larger volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Querying: SQL databases use a standardized query language (SQL) to retrieve and manipulate data, while NoSQL databases use different query languages depending on the database type and implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Consistency: SQL databases provide strong consistency, meaning that data is always up-to-date and accurate. NoSQL databases provide eventual consistency, meaning that data may take some time to propagate throughout the system, and different nodes may have different versions of the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data storage: SQL databases store data in tables, while NoSQL databases use various data storage models such as key-value stores, document databases, graph databases, and others.\n",
