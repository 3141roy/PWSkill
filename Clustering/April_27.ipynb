    "\n",
    "1. Initialization: Choose the number of clusters, K, and randomly initialize K points in the data space called centroids.\n",

While there is no definitive method to find the exact optimal value, several techniques can provide insights and help in making an informed decision. Here are some common methods for determining the optimal number of clusters in K-means clustering:\n",

The idea is to select the value of K at the \"elbow\" of the resulting curve, where the rate of decrease in WCSS slows down significantly. This point represents a trade-off between compactness of clusters and the number of clusters.\n",

Silhouette Coefficient: The Silhouette Coefficient measures the quality of clustering by calculating the average distance between data points within clusters (intra-cluster distance) and the average distance to the nearest neighboring cluster (inter-cluster distance). It ranges from -1 to 1, where values closer to 1 indicate well-separated clusters. The optimal number of clusters corresponds to the highest average Silhouette Coefficient across different values of K."

    "1. Initialization Sensitivity: K-means clustering is sensitive to the initial placement of centroids, which can result in different clustering outcomes. To mitigate this issue, you can run the algorithm multiple times with different initializations and choose the solution with the lowest within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) or the best clustering evaluation metric.\n",

To address this, you can use techniques such as the Elbow Method, Silhouette Coefficient, Gap Statistic, or information criteria to evaluate different values of K and choose the one that provides the best balance between cluster compactness and model complexity.\n",
